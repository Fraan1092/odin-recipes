    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yogurt is a product obtained from the fermentation of milk. Greek yogurt is a type of yogurt that we get when we filter out the whey from the milk, leaving us with a soft and creamy yogurt.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 grams natural yogurt</li>
        <li>1 liter skim milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk in a pot and heat it to 85 ÂºC </li>
        <li>Once the temp. is reached, pour the milk and the natural yogurt onto a jar and stir briefly</li>
        <li>Close the jar tightly and save it somewhere to keep its temperature</li>
        <li>Leave it overnight, preferrably 10 to 12 hours, to let it ferment</li>
        <li>After time has passed, use a fabric to filter the whey out for a minimum of 3 hours. The time depends on the texture desired.</li>
        <li>Once filtered, the yogurt is now ready. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
